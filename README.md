# covid-wastewater-bluesky

A Bluesky bot that posts state-by-state [COVID wastewater data from the US Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html)

[@COVID-wastewater@bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/COVID-wastewater.bsky.social) posts every Saturday (when the CDC posts fresh data) and again every Monday (when people actually look at their feeds).

## Key

Due to character limits, this bot truncates levels as per this key:

- 🔥: Very High
- 🔴: High
- 🟠: Moderate
- 🟡: Low
- 🟢: Minimal
- ❔: No Data

## Credits

This bot was written by [Eric Jacobsen](https://wvgg.co) [@wvgg.co](https://bsky.app/profile/wvgg.co).

This project was inspired and informed by [Waldo Jaquith](https://waldo.jaquith.org/)’s [COVID wastewater levels feed on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@covid_wastewater). Thanks, Waldo!

## Errata

I am not interested in opinions regarding COVID-19, the pandemic, masks, vaccines, chemtrails, Jeffrey Epstein, etc.

Message [@COVID-wastewater@bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/COVID-wastewater.bsky.social) with any other questions.
