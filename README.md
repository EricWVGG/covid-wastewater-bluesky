# covid-wastewater-bluesky

A Bluesky bot that posts state-by-state Covid wastewater data from the United States Center for Disease Control.

[@COVID-wastewater@bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/COVID-wastewater.bsky.social) posts every Saturday (when the CDC posts fresh data) and again every Monday (when people actually look at their feeds).

## Data

Data comes from the [CDC COVID-19 Current Wastewater Viral Activity Levels Map](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html). This bot

## Key

Due to character limits, this bot truncates levels as per this key:

- 🔥: Very High
- 🔴: High
- 🟠: Moderate
- 🟡: Low
- 🟢: Minimal
- ❔: No Data

## Errata

I am not interested in opinions regarding COVID-19, the pandemic, masks, vaccines, chemtrails, etc. Message @COVID-wastewater@bsky.social with any other questions.
