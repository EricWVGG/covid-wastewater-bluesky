# 💩 covid-wastewater-bluesky

A Bluesky bot that posts state-by-state [COVID-19 wastewater data from the US Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html).

[@covid-wastewater@bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/COVID-wastewater.bsky.social) posts every Saturday (when the CDC posts fresh data) and again every Monday (when people actually look at their feeds).

## FAQ

_Emoji?_ Due to Bluesky character limits, this bot truncates levels as per this key:

- 🔥: Very High
- 🔴: High
  🟠: Moderate
- 🟡: Low
- 🟢: Minimal
- ❔: No Data

_The CDC site admits that certain states return limited coverage, shouldn’t that factor into…_ No. This service is simply a relay, and does no data interpretation beyond the emoji index. If you desire better data, I urge you to write your state legislators.

_Why are replies disabled?_ Replies would clutter the feeds of followers. You are of course free to “quote” any post and begin a discussion in your own feed.
